                Let me first explain <strong>WHY YOU SHOULD PARTICIPATE !</strong> Everybody longs for financial abundance, health, pleasant family- and other relations, living in peace and  freedom, just feeling really happy.
                <u> But the reality is that the majority of all the people survive in more or less poverty,in stress, uncertainty or fear, being more or less suppressed or exploited, sick or unhappy. </u>

                If we concentrate on ‘having more money’, the ‘getting rich’  business is a ‘huge billion dollar business’<u>BUT it works only for 1 out of thousand readers.</u>One of these authors even explains WHY the results of all of them are so disappointing.
                But i think that his system as well creates no lasting results.

                First I ask some small daily efforts from you as a kind of necessary preparation, to open up your mind for the SIMPLE BUT UNBELIEVABLY POWERFUL TRUTH that will change your life completely when you apply it and keep applying that wisdom to attract ever MORE ABUNDANCE in every area of your life.

                information for which they paid.

                        Your CONSCIENCE that contains your will, character, higher thinking, ideas aso,
                        and that hungers for new experiences, new information, new knowledge,
                        but it can only process an average of 5 – 7 bits of information per second.

                It processes 10 quadrillion operations per second (10.000.000.000.000.000) and takes 6 trillion (6.000.000.000.000) decisions per second, to organize the 60 trillion cells in your body.
                Necessary decisions, if you know that each cell not only contains your complete DNA, but also houses different chemical factories and much more.This subconscious contains your ‘reptilian brain’, your ‘ego’.It’s basic task is to make your body function and keep it alive.In fact it is mostly a big database that contains all your past experiences, everything you saw, heard, felt, smelled and tasted.

                It also helps your ‘body’ to have more pleasure and avoid pain at all costs.It doesn’t like anything that’s new, because it only knows and can use your ‘past’ experiences to help you, and  because it cannot help you in ‘unknown terrain’
                When you were born, this ‘database’ was empty, ready to absorb all experiences. And because it depends on people who give your body food and attention, it stores as ‘good’ all that it sees and hears form its caretakers.(parents, other persons in the family, nurses, teachers aso)
                Then, around the age of 4-6,comes the WHY-period. When children endlessly keep asking their parents WHY, on every subject.This is very difficult for most parents,because they never thought about it themselves.They can only tell their children how they themselves see the world, which is based on what they learned as child, their education, young experiences aso.

        <div class="row form-group">

                Based on these answers, and the experiences of the child, it forms its own ‘funded certainties’ about its surroundings and about the world.BUT there is something very important that you should also know!! Your senses (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting) are sending millions of bits of information to your subconscience, every second. Your subconscious ‘judges’ all this in milliseconds. Only information that it considers ‘correct’ and ‘safe’ is stored in it’s database, and only a very tiny part of that is transferred to your conscience.
                This means that what you ‘see’ is not what your ‘eyes see’ but what your subconscious lets pass to your ‘visual brainparts’, after having thrown away most of what your eyes see, and only saving the parts that it considers ‘good’ for you.

        <div class="row form-group">
            <div class="col-md-12 ">
                So you only ’see’ what passes the ‘safety barriers’ and the ‘beliefs’ of your subconscience. <u>You ‘see’ a very tiny and colored  little bit, +- half a second after your eyes have seen ‘the full reality’ </u>
                Same with ‘what you hear’ also…This ‘filtered/colored information’ automatically is a ‘confirmation’ of your worldview, and this way your ‘colored beliefs’ were formed.
                And so your life will normally be a ‘copy’ of what you accepted as ‘true’ before the age of +- 7, and your unbelievably powerful subconscious will not accept ‘new truth’ when you get older.This is why the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.
                <u>But i found the perfect combination of solutions to influence and bypass the subconscious, to finally live in the abundance that your conscience wants.</u>

                you will feel stronger and more confident after the 1st month.
                But experiencing  the abundance will probably take 4-5 months,
                because you  have to change your wrong and rusted beliefs.
                If you don’t want to do this <u>homework for 15-30 minutes/day</u>
                during 4 months : FORGET IT
                because this course is NOT about KNOWING, but about DOING !!!!!!!

                We advize you to First only pay EBOOK 1 Although you will not have enough information and not enough training to go after big goals. I advize you a <strong>small goal</strong> to start with
                and if you do well the little daily homework you will probably be pleasantly surprised with the result and pay your next lesson with a big smile.

                There are only 2 risks :
                <strong>The biggest risk</strong> is the ‘reptilian brain’ in your subconscience
                This little devil will use all the tricks in the book to keep you as you are,
                because it hates change.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Example  : Each new principle is simple, maybe too simple.
                        So simple that your ‘ego’,  your internal ‘devil’,  will tell you :
                        This is ridiculous, you can as well ‘not’ do it every day
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Example  : Your little devil always uses your own voice.
                        When you hear yourself talking, it is never your higher self,
                        but your lower self, your reptilian brain.
                        (your higher self mostly speaks to you via ‘feelings’)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                How many times do you (your ego) say to yourself :  ‘i already know ’
                But there is a HUGE DIFFERENCE between ‘knowing it’ and  ‘KNOWING IT’
                We will tell you exactly how to REALLY KNOW something.
                This ‘365PLUS’ abundance project starts with  REALLY KNOWING.

                <u>The other risk</u> is that you will not apply completely all the lessons
                and excercises that we propose, for whatever reasons.
                If you really want peace, joy, liberty and abundance
                you may, just like many others, spend 5 to 10 years of your time
                and many thousands of dollars to guru’s, courses and books,
                and years later, you might remember this basic wonder-course you once bought,
                apply it completely, and finally enjoy it all.
