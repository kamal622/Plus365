			<b>YOUR  FIRST  STEP  to Abundance</b>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Let me first tell you something about the principles contained in the following  lessons.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			I copied this remark litterally from a book written by an author in the self-help-business.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Did you know that LESS THAN 1 % of people succeed with getting the life they desire after reading self help / personal development books or attending further training ?
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Actually the figure is a lot less than 1 %.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			In fact 99,86 % of people never manage to get their net worth to as much as One Million Dollars…
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Including their house and all other possessions.    And that’s hardly rich is it ?
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			So just 0,14 % get to be worth a mere $1 milion. Don’t you think that’s pathetic ?
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			So with all this ‘extra’ education, the self help world gets nowhere, sure you learn a bit and you feel good, but what counts are results,and they just don’t show up.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			You may want to read those last few sentences again, as THAT IS A MASSIVE FAILURE which in any other industry would never be tolerated. But remember, that is the system that YOU ARE USING TO ACHIEVE THE LIFE YOU DESIRE !   So how many books have you read on personal development ? So these books are giving you what exactly ? They are not giving you the life you are after, are they ?
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			So what actual massive life changes have you  got and retained after rading them ? Think about it…..
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			So who is to blame for this lack of results ?       That’s the question !
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Are the millions of people like you who read the personal development books all just “thick as 2 short planks ? ‘ Well, after reading hundreds of self help books myself, certainly i didn’t think so. In fact after several years of research , i came to the realisation that all the selfhelp books out there were ……written by teachers who were really clever and COULD DO IT, but unfortunately THEY CAN NOT TEACH IT ! Well actually they can, they can teach it to a very tiny group of people who either are already successful, or WILL  BECOME successful from either theirs or another’s teachings.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			You see success teachers currently can only teach the successful minority who still have their natural structures success thinking system.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			The unsuccessful majority who have lost their natural success system has no chance of learning it…..NONE ! Well they can learn it and talk about it and even teach it ….. They just can’t apply it !
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			I know what you’re thinking, that’s not true… some people succeed, and you’re right, under 1 % do.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			The truth is…. You don’t want it to be true…. As if it’s true then the thought you’ve just had in the dark corner of your mind may also be true … <b>That you cannot ever become successful ….</b>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Now that’s a painful thought, wich you don’t like to air too much… But the starting point for you and i is for me to get you to realise that the way you are doing it <b>isn’t ever going to work.</b>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			For this reason, i am only adding in the instruction to abundance, the principles of which i am 100 % certain
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			that you will understand them, that they are easy to apply,	and that they will help you, IF only YOU APPLY THEM.

	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			<u>This is without doubt  the most important info in your whole life</u><br />
			<u>So read it very slowly, and with an open mind</u><br />
			<u>Read it again if your mind ‘protests or has remarks’</u>

			<b>YOU BECOME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT</b>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Your mind can be compared to the furtile land of a farmer, on which he can saw whatever he likes.The land doesn’t care if he saws weeds or flowers. It will simply give him what he has sawn. Likewise your mind doesn’t care what you plant in it with your thoughts. If you plant negative thoughts, it will produce a negative reality. If you plant positive, happy thoughts, it will produce a positive, happy reality<br />

			<b>MONEY</b>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Money is the reward you receive from other people or from the universe for the services you render to other people.The more value (or whatever they want), that you procure to others, the more money(or whatever you want),  you will receive, directly from these people, or indirectly from other people.<br />

			<b>Principle  of  SILENCE</b>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Do NOT speak about this with ANYONE !!<br />
			This is exclusively your own INNER BATTLE with your REPTILIAN BRAIN
			(as explained in the invitation-email, your reptilian brain is a small but  important part
			of your subconscious brain. It is so to say the gate-keeper of your mind,your brain)<br />
			If you talk about this to others, you will also have to fight with their reptilian brains,
			and their (probably) bad habits and their (probably) wrong beliefs.<br />

			NEVER take the initiative to convince them of your new beliefs.<br />
			Just win your own battle and start to change and become wealthy
			or if you have another wish, realize that wish.<br />
			Only LATER, MUCH LATER you might explain it,
			but only to those that you know very well,
			and who seriously ask you to help them.<br />
			In that case,  do it slowly, step by step, just like i do with you.<br />
			And don’t explain the next step, until after they have proven
			that they seriously applied the previous step.

			<b>Principle of CLARITY</b>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			You have to know EXACTLY what you want.<br />

			<ul>
				<li>Health for you or your family ?</li>
			</ul>

			Take a piece of paper and WRITE IT DOWN……….   STOP READING AND    ……..   DO  IT    ……  NOW !
			<br />
			After that :  GET CLEARER
			Describe  IN   ALL   DETAILS the ENDRESULT that you want
			It is not enough to say : ‘I want ABUNDANCE’
			This would be like going to a restaurant
			And asking for ‘a lot of food’
			They can only serve you
			if you tell them  ‘exactly’  what you want.

			VERY IMPORTANT !!!
			Your purpose, your endresult
			HAS TO BE SOMETHING YOUR  “ H E A R T “  yearns for
			If you imagine that you reached your endresult
			you should  be able to FEEL the contentment, the joy, the happiness.

			In terms of financial abundance,

	<b>Principle of LANGUAGE</b>
	Your conscious mind only has just enough bites to express its wishes, desires and orders.
	It is your subconscious mind has the enormous power to arrange it all,
	but it will obey your orders
	<b>if</b> your orders are clear
	<b>and if</b> you use the language of your subconscious

	The language of your subconscious are your 5 SENSES + FEELINGS
	more specifically the way your subconscious sends
	the results of your 5 senses to your conscious brain,
	but this time ‘in reverse’.
	In your mind, you have to create a film, using all your senses,
	about how your desired situation should be.

	<b>You have to SEE</b> in your mind EXACTLY WHAT you will see when you realize your wish
	See the future images of your new situation, see your friends and family in that image
	with the colors, the light or darkness, shadows aso
	"Having clearly seen the end,
	you have created  the means to the realization of the end."

	<b>You have to HEAR</b> the sounds in that situation :
	What are people telling you ?
	Or telling to others about you ?
	What other sounds do you hear ?
	<b>Do you smell</b> something typical in that desired situation ?
	<b>Do you taste</b> something different ?
	<b>What do you feel</b> with your hands ? Or on other parts of your body ?
	<b>How do you feel internally ?</b>  You should feel immensely grateful !

	Your EGO (= your REPTILLIAN BRAIN = your little devil)
	does not like this at all, because it only knows your PAST.
	As it cannot imagine the future,  it will probably create future images
	based on your past bad experiences… to protect you .. to warn for risks …
	and use all possible subtle and less-subtle ways to obstruct your creative work.

	Resumed :
	This might be the most difficult of all the abundance principles,
	because YOU will have to to the creative work !!!!

	Just spend 10 minutes when you wake up
	on CREATING YOUR 100 % detailed film
	Seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling and tasting every detail in your imagination
	Not half an hour, just 10 minutes.
	But do it EVERY DAY a little better,
	a little clearer, with a little more details.

	And look out for your little devil.

	If you hear yourself saying something negative,
	that’s not in line with your desire, it’s HIM/HER talking with your voice.
	IMMEDIATELY change the thought, or change the words you hear
	to  the exact contrary.

	From now on : only positive thoughts, words, images and feelings.

	Practically : Work at the DETAILED DESCRIPTION of your perfect desired wish until
	you are completely satisfied with your text.

	Every morning when you wake up,
	enjoy your internal film +
	make it a little more perfect.
	Every noon + evening :  Slowly read your text.
	At night, before falling asleep,
	give thanks for all the good experiences of the day


	This is your first step to an easy and abundant life !
	Because science has found 1 weak aspect of your subconscience :
	1 action that your conscious can, but your unconscious cannot

	It can not distinguish a REAL EVENT from an event that you just IMAGINE

	That’s why you have to create, with your conscious mind, an internal imagined film
	and use all your senses,  and have pleasure in that film.

	The second task of your powerful lower subconscious (your little devil)
	is to make your body feel well.
	Only if you keep pushing and creating IMAGINED happy situations and experiences ,
	your subconscious will accept them as REAL and collaborate to give you more of them.



	30-DAY TEST AS PROOF OF THE FIRST LESSON
	Surely you have small desires and big desires.
	Think of 1 small desire that you would like to have within 30 days.
	Now take a card and write that desire on 1 side of the card.
	On the other side you write : 	ASK AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN YOU,								 SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND, 									KNOCK AND IT SHALL BE OPENED UNTO YOU.

	Think also of a service you could render to other people (f.ex. do your job better)
	or do for other people (f.ex. smile to  everyone you meet)
	Because there is a mental price to pay to become a real desire :

	Now the  MENTAL PRICE which you FIRST have to pay during these 30 days :
	1 accept  that you will harvest what you have sawn
	2 thank  the universe for granting you this desire within 30 days    				   see, hear, smell, taste,feel it
	3 do this IMMEDIATELY every time youthink about what you don’t want
	4 Whatever you do for a living, do it much better, with more pleasure and enthusiasm 		   or do something to make people really happy

	You may receive something else that you did not expect,
	but that will prove to be better for you

	Or if you don’t receive anything,
	you may not have done your homework well or with not enough enthusiasm
	So do it better  for 30 extra days.

	You will see that you will receive
	probably more than you invested mentally.
