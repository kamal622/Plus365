			Einstein : You cannot solve a problem with the same mentality that created the problem
			=  first your  ‘mental ity’  has to change.
			<br />If you stick to the same thoughts, the same words and the same actions,
			you will have the same results.

			<b>How to Create in the NOW ?</b>
			<br />Your powerful subconscious only knows the PAST, and its main task is to protect your body.
			So it will remember you again and again all your negative experiences in the past.
			BUT THE PAST …….PASSED !! 	 It is not here anymore !
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Your subconscious will also do everything it can to keep your future equal to your past.
			If you try to imagine a future that is different from the past,
			it will always picture dangerous situations, and the uncertainty and dangers
			of options  that are different from your past experiences.
			It will ALWAYS picture a DARK DANGEROUS future.
			But it doesn’t know ANYTHING about the future,
			And the future  may be totally different of what you think !
			BECAUSE  THE  FUTURE  IS  NOT  THERE  YET.       It is in the future….

				This means that the only thing you have is NOW !!         THE PRESENT MOMENT !!!
				<br />GOOD NEWS :
				<br />YOU  HAVE  THE  POWER  TO  CREATE  YOUR  FUTURE  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
				<br />and  this power  is in the ‘now’,
				<br />ONLY  in the PRESENT  you can INFLUENCE and CREATE YOUR FUTURE !!
			</b>

			HOW ?

			<b>
				<br />By your thoughts, words and actions

				<br />Whatever you think, say or do,

				<br />you always get it back ‘multiplied’

				<br />Because you live in an abundant universe !
			</b>
			<br />
			The abundant life is like a mirror, a multiplying mirror
			If you smile in the mirror, the mirror smiles back
			If you have the habit of smiling at people, not only they  smile back
			but even more, they start smiling even before you smile !!

			If you want more LOVE in you life,
			You first have to create loving thoughts inside you,
			saying loving words, do loving things to others.
			And suddenly, as by miracle, out of the blue,
			a multitude of love will come into your life
			<br />
			If you want more MONEY  in your life,
			First give away a part of the money that you have
			to people who have less.
			The bible speaks of giving 10 % of your net income,
			to a church of Christ,
			that will redistribute it anonymously to people in real need
			(choose an ‘active’ church, in which you ‘feel’ the ‘believe’
			and  where they explain the ‘works’ of Jezus)
			<br />===  Bible    :	Malaquias  3, 10
			<br />===  Bible    :      Matthew 6 : 3   +  6 : 6
			<br />===  Bible    :     Luke  6 : 38
			<br />===  Bible    :     Proverbs  3 : 9
			<br />
			GIVING ‘without expecting to get it back’’ has another reason !!
			It changes your deepest feelings of neediness
			to a feeling of ‘i have more than enough’
			Everyone has something to give. A hug, a smile, a kind word
			Give often , from your heart,  to all you meet.
