			From now on EACH EVENING  you write on a piece of paper

		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			FEELING because feeling is the language of your higher conscious
			It will create more of what you feel grateful for.
			<br />
			GRATEFUL  because  grateful feelings  are positive feelings,
			that will attract more positive events in your life
			<br />
			Also during your 6 x 5 minutes, try to FEEL
			the contentment, the joy, the happiness of having realised your end-result
			<br />
			Combine this with REPEATED constructive, harmonious thoughts and images,
			because by repetition your subconscious creates new  pathways.

			LIVING  IN  ABUNDANCE  CAN  BE  SO  EASY !!

			You are a spiritual being (soul) living temporarily in a fysical body with a fysical brain.

	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			But have you been living your life at a low ‘reptile-level vibration’
			living in sin, greed, lying, oversexed, in vanity, jalousy,
			gluttony, wrath, laziness aso…?
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Or have you been living at a higher spiritual level ?
			With virtues like honesty, loyalty, generosity, humility, charity,
			meekness, chastity, temperance, zeal ... aso ?

			It has been proven that everyone automatically attracts things, events, persons
			which are at his own vibration-level.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			This means that if you want to attract something of higher value in your life,
			you first have to lift your internal vibration.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			<b>How do you lift your internal vibration ?</b>
			<br />
			By turning	 greed   into generosity, charity
			Lying     into	honesty
			Laziness   into 	zeal
			Wrath  into	temperance
			Sexual desire into chastity
			Vanity   into 	humility
			Gluttony   into	temperance

			Turning all your ‘sins’ into ‘virtues’  is

			===  Bible Matthew 6 : 4-6
			<br />
			But you, when you pray, enter in your inner room, and  having shut your door,
			pray to your havenly Father , who is in secret,
			and your heavenly Father who sees in secret
			will reward you openly.

		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			HOW TO APPLY THIS ?
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row form-group">
		<div class="col-md-12 ">
			Make a list of your personal  imperfections.
			Take the imperfection that is easiest to eliminate from your life.
			Work on that for 1 month.
			<br />
			ONLY ON THAT  1,   not more, because you will need that month
			because when you started to ‘create’ that bad habit,
			there was a reason for it.
			So you have to ‘reason’ with your mind about the ‘reason’ you started with it,
			Talk this ‘imperfection’  ‘reasonably’ out of your mind
			and change that bad habit (sin)  into a new habit (virtue).
			<br />
			This way you will slowly get stronger and stronger
			in turning your ‘sins’ into ‘virtues’
